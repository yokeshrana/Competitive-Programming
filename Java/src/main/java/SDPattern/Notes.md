#Design Pattern
We can basically divide design pattern into three types

###Creational
-> Provides way to create objects

eg Factory ,Builder ,Prototype ,Singleton

###Structural
-> Helps in structuring the objects and classes

eg Adaptor ,Decorator , Proxy

###Behaviourical
-> Defines ways of communication and interaction b/w the objects

eg Command ,Iterator ,Proxy ,Observer


## SOLID Principles
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The single responsibility principle ensures that every class or module should be accountable and responsible for only one functionality. There should be one and only one reason for changing any class.

O - Open Closed Principle (OCP): Every class is open for extension but closed for modification. Here, we are allowed to extend the entities behaviour by not modifying anything in the existing source code.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP): LSP principle states that the objects can be replaced by the subtype instances without affecting the correctness of the program.

I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The ISP principle states that we can use as many interfaces specific to the clientâ€™s requirements instead of creating only one general interface. Clients should not be forced to implement the functionalities that they do not require.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle: Here, the high-level modules should not be dependent on the lower level modules or concrete implementations. Instead, they should be dependent on the abstractions.
